# PrePATH: A Toolkit for Preprocessing Whole Slide Images 
This toolkit is built on [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM) and [Aslide](https://github.com/MrPeterJin/ASlide).


## Install
We recommend to use Annconda to install the toolkit.
For the GPFM model, run following code: 
```bash
git clone https://github.com/birkhoffkiki/PrePATH.git
cd PrePATH
conda create --name gpfm python=3.10
conda activate gpfm
pip install -r requirements/gpfm.txt
cd models/ckpts/
wget https://github.com/birkhoffkiki/GPFM/releases/download/ckpt/GPFM.pth
```
NOTE that: You may need to install `openslide-tools`.  
For the environment of other models, please refer to the repository of each model.

## Step 1: Patching
We need to find the coordinates of patches with foreground in the WSI

```bash
# before run following code, open the example file and remeber to edit variables defined in the script.
bash scripts/get_coors/SAL/sal.sh
```
## Step 2: Extracting features
```bash
# extract features, see scripts for details
bash scripts/extract_feature/sal.sh
```

## Supported Foundation Models (patch-level feature extractors)
If you want to extract feature using **ResNet50** and **GPFM**, set `models="resnet50 gpfm"` in the `script/extract_feature/exe.sh`  
Please note you need to install corresponding python environment.
